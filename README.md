# Prerequisites 
- Using the OpenSCAD models here requires adding the file Tagging.scad, found in [here](http://www.github.com/Xasin/TRRIAN), to be placed in the OpenSCAD search path under "TagSystem/Tagging.scad"
- To properly work with the AVR Code, it is recommended to install the [AVR-Plugin for eclipse][avrplug] (for C and C++ eclipse versions)
  Currently, there is no workspace, so wait for updates!
